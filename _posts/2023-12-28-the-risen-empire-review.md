The vibes are somewhere between Gideon the Ninth, This Is How You Lose the Time War, and Star Wars prequel trilogy.

Which is to say, it’s about an empire of the living and risen dead how worship their Undead Emperor, who was the first to figure out how to raise the dead, and the characters are fighting against a different empire who is very technology forward and worships planet-wide AI systems, with the main drama being the military officer trying to resolve the hostage situation that allowed the birth of a planet-wide AI inside the undead empire and then has to hold off a communication ship, and a senator who is against raising the dead and is a moral pacifist but still ends up on the War Council representing her faction and has to make decisions that get people killed and reveal the horrific lengths the Emperor is willing to go to to not allow the enemy empire to contact the planet-wide AI, since the AI has learned secrets about the Emperor that he doesn’t want anyone to know.

The technical aspects of the sci-fi drag, although there are interesting points to it (the synesthesia to process information, relative vs absolute time due to light speed travel and cryo-sleep, the AI house and all the different cultures that interact with AI differently).

The switching POVs grew on me, and I liked how some were introduced early to establish skill/importance, and then they were plot relevant later.

I didn’t like Hobbes’ crush on the captain, or how she was made extremely beautiful through surgery that made people take her not seriously- otherwise a great character; Rana was fun, I did like her romantic subplot with h_rd, except the end where they suddenly moved very quickly without anymore on screen development, and Bassiritz was a great little marine who had good insight into the mindset of a normal-ish person- all of these side characters were pretty great at giving windows to various different factions and backgrounds.

The romantic subplot between Laurent and Nara was exactly one extended date where they met, went to a private house for a few days where they shared their trauma, and then separated for a few years but were still driven by each other- it could have been better.

The “secret” that the political skilled the Childlike Empress to keep is obviously something about how immortality doesn’t last forever after death, or that it has to be supplemented with something, or that it’s enforced by the kind of AI technology that the empire supposedly hates- this would also explain why the “grays” (undead) live in separate, “no” technology societies, and go on long pilgrimage trips away from people who knew them.

The childlike empress- didn’t investigate how terrible it would be to be trapped developmentally as a child, despite accumulating thousands of years of knowledge, she was incredibly unimportant and was fridged immediately at the beginning of the book, how terrible to be known as “the Reason”, but not because you are reasonable or logical, but because you are the motivation for the male-god character- weird to have the girl be 12 and her “brother” is in his mid thirties? It happens but it’s unusual- it’s also unclarified what illness the girl had.
