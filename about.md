In high school, I became very interested in biology and psychology, 
studying them independently and TAing classes for lower years. When 
debating over what to major in, I was excited to discover Northeastern 
Univdersity's Behavioral Neuroscience program, which started as a 
combined biology/psychology degree. 

I still jumped around a lot, between cognition, lingutistics, learning 
and memory, and computer science, before going on my first coop at 
Harvard Medical School's Datta Lab. There, I investigated the role of 
the Ms4a family of olfactory receptors, which are different from 
conventional olfactory receptors due to hacing multiple types of 
receptors on a single neuron. I investigated these pathways through 
social transmission of food preferencce experiments in mice, as well 
as through innate preference experiments. I also tracked the movement 
of the mice in these experiments, and did supervised machine learning.

Straight off of my coop, I went on a two month study abroad around 
Europe, studying rhetoric and human rights. 

Coming back to Boston, and back to science, I was still interested 
in movement. I joined the Action Lab at Northeastern, and have been 
working on investigating the role of learning and primitive dynamics 
in a whip-to-target task.
