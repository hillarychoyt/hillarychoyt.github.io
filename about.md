In high school, I became very interested in biology and psychology, 
studying them independently and TAing classes for lower years. When 
debating over what to major in, I was excited to discover Northeastern 
University's Behavioral Neuroscience program, which started as a 
combined biology/psychology degree. 

I still jumped around a lot, between cognition, linguistics, learning 
and memory, and computer science, before going on my first coop (a 
full-time, 6 month internship between semsesters) at Harvard Medical 
School's [Datta Lab](http://datta.hms.harvard.edu/). There, I investigated the role of olfactoy neurons expressing the [Ms4a](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/InterPro/IPR030417/) family 
of receptors, which are different from conventional olfactory 
neurons due to having multiple types of receptors on a single neuron. 
I investigated these pathways through social transmission of food 
preferencce experiments in mice, as well as through innate preference 
experiments. I also tracked the movement of the mice in these 
experiments,and did supervised machine learning.

Straight off of my coop, I went on a two month study abroad around 
Europe, studying rhetoric and human rights. 

Coming back to Boston, and back to science, I was still interested in 
movement. I had attended a talk given by Dagmar Sternad as a part of 
Northeastern's Brain Awareness week, and I was fascinated by the 
questions of motor control. I joined the [Action Lab](https://web.northeastern.edu/actionlab/) at Northeastern, and worked on investigating the role of learning and primitive 
dynamics in a whip-to-target task. 

Around the same time, I took a class called Brain, Behavior, and Immunity, about the connection between the immune system and neurological systems. The gut-brain axis, how people behave when they are sick and why they do it, the way that the brain can influence the immune system and vice versa; it was my first structured study into the immune system, and I was hooked. For my next coop, I started working in the Cancer Immunotherapy team at Vor Biopharma, investigating edited T cells to treat blood cancers. I was hooked, and have been working there ever since!

My ORCID is <img src="https://orcid.org/sites/default/files/images/orcid_16x16(1).gif" alt="ORCID" />

Outside of academics and work, I enjoy running, playing ultimate frisbee, reading, baking, 
and dancing.
